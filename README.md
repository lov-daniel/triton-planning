## Degree Visualizer (UCSD)

> ‚è∞ **Last Updated:** August 27, 2024 (11:28PM)

> üóíÔ∏è **Note:** This project is not directly sponsored or affilated with the University of California, San Diego. I am a student who believes that the current tools for planning degrees are not adequate enough and thinks that this would be a neat solution.
<br/>

The basic premise behind this project is to provide an interactive degree map, that will can be exported/shared with other students, meaning that existing degree plans can be used by future students as a form of advice or guidance. Current students will be able to import their current academic histories in order to automatically check off any classes that may apply.

> üí° **Planned Features:**
> <br> - Some form of machine learning to automatically make template degree plans on request that is trained on user generated content.
> <br> - Permalink so degrees plans can be viewed without account creation to anonymous users (will still require login to edit).


(insert photos here of finished product lol)
## Tech Stack
| Technology      | Reason for Decision |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Javascript      | Primary language used, interacts directly with other components, didn't feel like learning TypeScript :P |
| React   | Primary framework being used, felt like a good choice and really wanted to practice using it.  |
| Bootstrap | Primary CSS library to help clean up CSS and make things look better in a much more efficient way. |
| Node.JS | Best choice (imo) since I'm already writing in JS and utilizing React. Node.JS has a large community of packages, very useful. |
| Express.JS | Same reasoning as Node.JS for the most part. |
| Auth0 | Very easy to integrate authentication system. |
| Database | Undecided as of date, however most likely will be an SQL database. Looking towards MySQL. |
